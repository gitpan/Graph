	* Fix set_graph_attribute() documentation not to talk about $u, $v
	  (noticed by Kurt Jaeger).

	* A mysterious failure fixed by a mysterious fix: under some
	  circumstances it seems that an each() doesn't walk through
	  all the key-value pairs, the workaround is to reset the
	  each() iterator by a keys() call.  Not simple test code,
	  sadly, since the existing test code (see the case) is 13 kB
	  and non-trivial.
	  [rt.cpan.org #9461]

	* Add a safety guard against a missing Scalar::Util::weaken
	  [rt.cpan.org #9481]

	* Release as 0.52.

	* Allow calling Makefile.PL with arguments other than --renum
	  (which is for internal use only, and therefore undocumented).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9481]

	* Remove the add_graph() and delete_graph() interfaces, sorry
	  if you were already using them, but the current interface was
	  very poor and the concept ill-planned.  If you want to merge or
	  remove edges and vertices between your graph, you can probably
	  yourself implement the exactly right things to do.
	  [rt.cpan.org #9493]

	* Document that one cannot assume Graphs are blessed hash references
	  (and the likely error message one will get if one so assumes).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9505]

	* Fix Andras' last name (sorry).

	* Merge duplicate documentation of find_a_cycle(). 

	* Graph::AdjacencyMap::Base does not exist, fix Graph/AdjacencyMap.pm
	  pod to comply.

	* Release as 0.51.

	* The 0.50.

2004-10-30  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Start wrapping up for the 0.50 release.

	* Start bothering beta testers.
