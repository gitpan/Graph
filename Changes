	* Allow calling Makefile.PL with arguments other than --renum
	  (which is for internal use only, and therefore undocumented).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9481]

	* Remove the add_graph() and delete_graph() interfaces, sorry
	  if you were using them, but the current interface was very
	  poor and the concept ill-planned.  If you want to merge or
	  remove edges and vertices between your graph, you can probably
	  implement the exactly right things to do.
	  [rt.cpan.org #9493]

	* Document that one cannot assume Graphs are blessed hash references
	  (and the likely error message one will get if one so assumes).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9505]

	* Fix Andras' last name (sorry).

	* Merge duplicate documentation of find_a_cycle(). 

	* Graph::AdjacencyMap::Base does not exist, fix Graph/AdjacencyMap.pm
	  pod to comply.

	* Release as 0.50.

	* Start wrapping up for the 0.50 release.

	* Start bothering beta testers.
