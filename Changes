2005-05-15  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Tests added to 64_ref.t to verify that using different kinds
	  of blessed references as vertices works okay.  Few bugs found
	  by these tests squashed.

	* Release as 0.65.

2005-05-14  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Fix for [rt.cpan.org #12509] Errors using objects as nodes,
	  patch from the reporter of the bug, add t/u/bb_rv.t.

	* Fix for refvertexed isolated vertices not having overloaded cmp
	  and graph string presentation failing because of that.

	* The <NOTE>s needed to be B<NOTE>s.

	* Release as 0.64.

2005-04-16  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* After setting a vertex attribute one could not delete
	  non-attributed vertices, reported by Joseph Hamilton.

	* Inlining to speed up path_vertices() slightly.

	* Release as 0.63.

2005-04-10  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* The documentation of add_weighted_vertices was wrong:
	  the arguments are (v1, w1, v2, w2, ...) instead of (v1, v2, ..., w).

	* Made calling interfaces with an "options hash" like new()
	  and random_graph() more robust, now bails out earlier instead
	  of dieing mysteriously later with an "odd number of arguments"

	* Allow running under -d:DProf even when using random shuffling:
	  workaround for List::Util::shuffle and -d:DProf not working
	  together ([perl #32383]) by falling back to Fisher-Yates shuffle
	  if (any use of) the -d: is detected.

	* Allow calling random_graph() also as a class method:
	  Graph::random_graph(...) (the resulting graph will be a 'Graph').

	* in_degree() and out_degree() (and therefore vertex_degree())
	  were one too low for self-loop vertices in undirected graphs
	  (the self-loop edge was not counted).

	* Release as 0.62.

2005-03-27  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* [rt.cpan.org #12023] from Macha Nikolski:
	  deleting an attributed vertex left the graph in a state
	  where has_vertex() returned correctly false but vertices()
	  still wrongly returned the freshly deleted vertex.

	* A few missing "See":s added to the pod.

	* Release as 0.61.

2005-03-25  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Bug reported by Richard Ball: connected_component_by_index()
	  and connected_component_by_vertex() were starting their indexing
	  from one, not zero.

	* t/27_hyperedged.t was really testing for turning on
	  hypervertexedness (the actual functionality was being
	  tested correctly in t/32_hyperedge.t).

	* Release as 0.60.

2005-03-03  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* deep_copy_graph() could not handle code references since
	  Data::Dumper by default doesn't handle those.  Now uses
	  the Deparse option for 5.8.x and later.

	* The removed interfaces add_graph() and delete_graph() still
	  had their documentation hanging around.

	* Release as 0.59.

2005-02-19  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Document that using attributes does have a slowing down
	  effect on other graph operations
	  [rt.cpan.org #11498]
	  Performance problem: edge attributes slow source_vertices)
	  This is unlikely to get fixed any time soon, I am afraid,
	  this is one of those working-as-designed-and-correctly-but-
	  unfortunately-slow things.

	* Document that Graph 0.2xxx edges($v) is now edges_at($v)
	  [rt.cpan.org #11494]

	* [rt.cpan.org #11543]: self-edges reported twice by edges_at().

	* Declare/document that any attributes beginning with an underscore
	  are reserved for the internal use of Graph.

	* Various inlining optimizations: should run 5-10% faster
	  than the 0.57.

	* Release as 0.58.

2005-02-12  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Further 10% speedup on 'make test' on top of 0.56 by inlining
	  various code paths related to finding edges, now 'make test'
	  is cumulatively about 15% faster than the 0.55 release.
	  The test case of [rt.cpan.org #11465] is about 10 times faster.

	* Release as 0.57.

2005-02-12  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Rewrite edges finding code (like edges_at()) to avoid a
	  quadratic algorithm.  Shame on me.  Luckily this extremely
	  slow path was not touched that often, but [rt.cpan.org #11465]
	  shows one known bad case, source_vertices() for compat02
	  graphs.  The removal of the slow path sped up 'make test'
	  by about 5-10%.

	* Remove a voodoo keys() from vertices_at().

	* Document stubs for Graph::Directed and Graph::Undirected.
	
	* Tiny documentation tweaks.

	* Release as 0.56.

2005-01-22  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Add unset_row(), get_row(), set_row(), and unset_row(), methods
	  to Graph::BitMatrix and make it public (remove the "internal use
	  only" warning from it).  Add t/82_bitmatrix.t.

	* Add vertex_degree() as an alias for degree().

	* One more alternative solution for spt.t from Koen.

	* I seem to have this drive to misspell people's names.
	  Sorry, Koen.

	* Release as 0.55.

2005-01-16  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* More bugs found in set_vertex_attribute(), fixed and tests
	  added.  (Basically the same failure pattern as with the
	  [rt.cpan.org #9461]: after setting vertex attributes many of
	  the 'structural' methods such as predecessors() often returned
	  wrong results.)

	* More alternative solutions to spt.t, diameter.t, and dump.t,
	  found by the PRNG of Koen van der Drift in Mac OS X 10.3.7,
	  Perl 5.8.1.

	* Release as 0.54.

2005-01-14  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* The #9461 was still there.
	  But now we have a simple test case from Sebastian Nagel.
	  The real culprit seemed to be a misapplied optimisation.

	* Release as 0.53.

2005-01-12  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Fix set_graph_attribute() documentation not to talk about $u, $v
	  (noticed by Kurt Jaeger).

	* A mysterious failure fixed by a mysterious fix: under some
	  circumstances it seems that an each() doesn't walk through
	  all the key-value pairs, the workaround is to reset the
	  each() iterator by a keys() call.  Not simple test code,
	  sadly, since the existing test code (see the case) is 13 kB
	  and non-trivial.
	  [rt.cpan.org #9461]

	* Add a safety guard against a missing Scalar::Util::weaken
	  [rt.cpan.org #9481]

	* Release as 0.52.

2005-01-09  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Allow calling Makefile.PL with arguments other than --renum
	  (which is for internal use only, and therefore undocumented).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9481]

	* Remove the add_graph() and delete_graph() interfaces, sorry
	  if you were already using them, but the current interface was
	  very poor and the concept ill-planned.  If you want to merge or
	  remove edges and vertices between your graph, you can probably
	  yourself implement the exactly right things to do.
	  [rt.cpan.org #9493]

	* Document that one cannot assume Graphs are blessed hash references
	  (and the likely error message one will get if one so assumes).
	  [rt.cpan.org #9505]

	* Fix Andras' last name (sorry).

	* Merge duplicate documentation of find_a_cycle(). 

	* Graph::AdjacencyMap::Base does not exist, fix Graph/AdjacencyMap.pm
	  pod to comply.

	* Release as 0.51.

2005-01-01  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* The 0.50.

2004-10-30  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Start wrapping up for the 0.50 release.

	* Start bothering beta testers.
