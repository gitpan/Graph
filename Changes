	* Release 0.20102:
	  Since my work on the "Graph NG" is progressing painfully slowly,
	  I'm releasing this as a stopgap measure, but the DISCLAIMER still
	  is applicable.

	  Various bug fixes, especially for the strongly connected components.
	  Contributors, either of fixes or test cases, in no particular order:
	  Tom Anderson, frederik, Alex Harper, David Sanders, ethani, nadav,
	  Heikki Lehv√§slaiho, Bob Mathews.
