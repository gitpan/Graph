	* Release 0.20105:

	  Patch from Andras Solomon to allow inheriting constructors.

	* Release 0.20104:

	  Actually implement the "use Graph vertices_unsorted => 1"
	  promised in 0.20103, I don't know where that chunk of code
	  disappeared.  Add a test for it.

	  Change the strongly_connected_graph to sort the vertices
	  of strongly connected component vertices so that the
	  subtest #6 of 09scc.t doesn't depend on the 'hash order'.
	
	  Spell Andras' name correctly.

	* Release 0.20103:

	  Further strongly connected component fixes from Andras Salamon.

	  Add vertices_unsorted() that avoids the slowness
	  (unnecessary sort()) of vertices().  To replace vertices()
	  with vertices_unsorted() do

	      use Graph vertices_unsorted => 1;

	  Add new methods: is_predecessorless_vertex(),
	  is_successorless_vertex(), predecessorless_vertices(),
	  successorless_vertices(), cousins of is_source_vertex(),
	  is_sink_vertex(), source_vertices(), sink_vertices().

	* "Graph NG" about 75% done, for those who care.
	  (Does anyone read these notes?)

	* Release 0.20102:
	  Since my work on the "Graph NG" is progressing painfully slowly,
	  I'm releasing this as a stopgap measure, but the DISCLAIMER still
	  is applicable.

	  Various bug fixes, especially for the strongly connected components.
	  Contributors, either of fixes or test cases, in no particular order:
	  Tom Anderson, frederik, Alex Harper, David Sanders, ethani, nadav,
	  Heikki Lehv√§slaiho, Bob Mathews.

2002-10-10  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 0.20101: Add the DISCLAIMER.  Sorry, no bug fixes.
	  Read the DISCLAIMER to learn why.

1999-10-14  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release 0.201: Changed the output of toposort() to
	  comply with the one in the Wolf book.
