As of October 2002 I'm currently (very slowly) working on a full
reimplementation of the Graph module.  Yes, this is what I've been
telling people for (almost to a day) three years now.  But that's how
it is.  Because of this, I am unlikely to find any time or energy to
actually fix any bugs in this old Graph 0.2* series.  Yes, there are
known bugs.

Especially known to be broken is the code for detecting strong elements.

I'm very sorry for this long and no doubt uncomfortable delay, but I
have been otherwise very busy during the last few years, and still am.

My suggestion for now is to report the bugs in CPAN using the RT request
tracking system of CPAN: http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Graph
so that I can verify the new implementation with the old bugs.
