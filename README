As you can guess from the version number this software is
still somewhat unstable.  The implementations may be extremely
buggy, the APIs can change.  You have been warned.

NOTE: the release 0.003 does not contain all the algorithms that 0.001
(and the never-publicly-released 0.002) had.  They are under
reconstruction as the data structures underwent a major overhaul in
0.003.
